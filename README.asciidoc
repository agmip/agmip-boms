AgMIP BOMs
==========

The AgMIP BOMs provide version management for depenedencies in AgMIP products, ensuring
developers have a compatable development stack. This also provides profiles for deploying
snapshots (`agmip-deploy`) and releases (`agmip-release`) to Maven Central. The
`agmip-deploy` profile is on by default; the `agmip-release` profile requires
configuration inside your `settings.xml` and is outside the scope of this README.
